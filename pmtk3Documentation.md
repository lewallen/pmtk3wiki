Root documentation page for PMTK3.

(Note: the documentation was moved from
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/w/list">googlecode</a>
to github in January 2014, which has messed up the formatting.
If a page is unreadable, please consult the original version
at googlecode, or better yet, fix the github version and commit your changes, so others can benefit!)
